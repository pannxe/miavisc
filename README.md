# Miavisc is a Video → Slide Converter

Miavisc stands for 'Miavisc is a Video → Slide Converter'

Born out of my frustration, this tool will convert video of a lecture to pdf file. Key features includes:

- **Tunable similarity threshold** — so slightly different frame due to mouse movement / lazer pointers are not treated as different page
- **Selectable ignored area** — e.g., camera-frame will be replaced with blank square

To any professors out there, for the love of capybara and all is that holy in the world, **PLEASE PROVIDE PDF OF YOUR LECTURE VIDEO**.

## Dependencies

[`ffmpeg-python`](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python) and `ffmpeg` itself
